I spent some time playing with LNP and fell in love with the enhanced UI.

I decided to install it onto my vanilla DF. First attempt failed, forgot that
despite this copy being 32-bit, it goes by my 64-bit gcc.

Running a diff of LNP's dfhack.init and the one that I just installed, reveals
only 2 small differences: something about kitchen keys.

Now to see if I can simply plop over df_extras.init. Hm, Multilevel's not a
recognized command, removing. Other than that it seems like it works perfectly.

I also installed Dwarf Therapist into my formerly vanilla DF. 

I have a fish function called dwarf that aliases to the df executable. I have
another called dwarfshrink, that aliases to dwarftherapist. I can't seem to get
them both to run together, only sequentially. I have to manually start up dwarf
therapist after opening dfhack.
