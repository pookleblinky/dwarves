I started out with a basic df_linux-44.05.

Made a bunch of worlds, goofed off.

Then I installed Enay's LNP. Fell in love with the enhanced performance. Made a
bunch of worlds, goofed off.

I discovered that Therapist could connect to my original DF, not just the 43.05
version it came with. Cp'd over that and dfhack into 44.05, and it worked
perfectly. Updated therapist to 39.2 via appimage, worked fine.

Now I had two separate versions, one mostly vanilla and one as an LNP.

mkdir LNP-44.05
rm df_linux from that
mv 44.05 df_linux into it

And bam, LNP runs on 44.05 seemingly without a hitch.

mv'd both previous versions to an external turtle folder, DFbackups, just in case. Then
changed fish function to point to the new startlnp.

Imported from both previous versions, it seems to have gone off without a hitch.
Some of the graphics packs are not available due to their manifests saying the
max version is lower than 44.05, but I use Bisasam ascii so eh.

Hm, spoke too soon. Therapist now says it doesn't know how to connect to 44.05,
even though it was doing it perfectly earlier. TWBT also throwing up an error
where before it wasn't. Hm. 39.2 therapist should connect to 44.05 according to
its git readme, and I've seen it do it. I suspect the checksum just isn't
matching for some reason.

Grabbed v44.05 memory layout from Dwarf-Therapist/Dwarf-Therapist on github,
plopped it in. Still unknown game version. Aha, accidentally plopped into just
memory_layouts. Moved into memory_layouts/linux where it should be, and upon
connecting it downloaded the right layout into memory_layouts/share/linux and
connected without a hitch. Woot.

cp'd twbt.plug.so from old lnp to new, gonna see if that works. Yep, seems to.

Now: peridexiserrant.txt seems to not be working. Getting an error in TkTinker:
interface.txt missing from baselines. Moving it over now and... it loaded.

Rough steps to reproduce:

1. Download Enay's LNP. It'll be version
43.05 https://github.com/Lazy-Newb-Pack/Lazy-Newb-Pack-Linux
2. Download vanilla DF: http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/df_44_05_linux.tar.bz2
3. Download DFhack https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/releases
4. Unpack DFhack into 44.05 df_linux
5. Add onMapload init etc from LNP into the vanilla DF.
6. Replace LNP's df_linux with 44.05 df_linux
7. Grab 44.05 memory layout ini for Dwarf Therapist from
https://github.com/Dwarf-Therapist/Dwarf-Therapist/tree/master/share/memory_layouts/linux
8. Grab the latest AppImage release of Dwarf Therapist from
https://github.com/Dwarf-Therapist/Dwarf-Therapist/releases/tag/v39.2.0
9. Replace dwarf therapist executable with AppImage
10. Add 44.05 memory layout ini to
dwarf_therapist/share/dwarftherapist/memorylayouts/linux
11. Check to make sure LNP/baselines contains vanilla interface.txt
12. Check to make sure df_linux/hack/plugins contains twbt.plug.so executable
13. Sacrifice goat to elder gods
14. You should now have DF 44.05 running with latest Dwarf Therapist

Updated graphics packs from https://github.com/DFgraphics to allow 44.05
support.

No twbt so far. Installed the Linux Dwarf Pack from
http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=13491 which does have twbt, but it's a
bit sparse. Eh, it's an alternative if I feel like it. 

Just tried it out. Ooh, twbt is nice when it's actually set up properly. Gemset
is legible, not wingdings made out of birds. 

Now importing from the frankenstein's dwarf. Hm. May also transfer over the
embark profiles and such.

Looked, my data/save folder was already ~500mb. Way way too much cluttering
autosaves which I will almost certainly never touch. mv'd all the -00* autosaves
to turtle/DFbackups/autosaves with its 2tb of storage, checked again, 168mb.

Doesn't seem to be a nice way of specifying a save folder, and the utility is
low unless I've sunk a lot of time into a fort. So, turned off autosaves and
autobackups.

What I may do instead is make a script that'll check how old a fort is, and if
past $age remind me that it'd be a good idea to start backing it up. No point in
having hundreds of megs of <1 year old forts laying around.
