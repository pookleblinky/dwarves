I started out with a basic df_linux-44.05.

Made a bunch of worlds, goofed off.

Then I installed Enay's LNP. Fell in love with the enhanced performance. Made a
bunch of worlds, goofed off.

I discovered that Therapist could connect to my original DF, not just the 43.05
version it came with. Cp'd over that and dfhack into 44.05, and it worked
perfectly. Updated therapist to 39.2 via appimage, worked fine.

Now I had two separate versions, one mostly vanilla and one as an LNP.

mkdir LNP-44.05
rm df_linux from that
mv 44.05 df_linux into it

And bam, LNP runs on 44.05 seemingly without a hitch.

mv'd both previous versions to an external turtle folder, DFbackups, just in case. Then
changed fish function to point to the new startlnp.

Imported from both previous versions, it seems to have gone off without a hitch.
Some of the graphics packs are not available due to their manifests saying the
max version is lower than 44.05, but I use Bisasam ascii so eh.

Hm, spoke too soon. Therapist now says it doesn't know how to connect to 44.05,
even though it was doing it perfectly earlier. TWBT also throwing up an error
where before it wasn't. Hm. 39.2 therapist should connect to 44.05 according to
its git readme, and I've seen it do it. I suspect the checksum just isn't
matching for some reason.
