Every fortress dies, often in gory fashion. Here's where I do a postmortem on them.

* Amostotten
* Koganum
First LNP fortress. Retired due to bug with graphics packs: switching
them changed the plump helmets or barrels, breaking the still. Despite
2 brewers, a field full of plump helmets, plenty of barrels, the still
couldn't find unrotten plants. 

Next time, stick with one graphics pack for each run. Change it up for
each fortress, maybe.
