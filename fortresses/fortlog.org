Right now I have a few forts in various worlds, all mostly just goofing around.
One world is LNP Testbed, I'm using it for playing with DFhack and Therapist
mechanics and such. 

So, notable forts get their own orgfiles and postmortems. It's not that
interesting to mention "killed fort about a month into its existence because I'd
fucked up seed logistics."

But what about the non-notable forts? The ones where I generate dwarves just to
blip into existence, try out something, then cast back into the digital ether? I
should log them somehow.

Plan: toplevel FORT - DATE STARTED. If the fort's notable, it's gonna have its
own org and I can just point to it. If it's a testbed fort, just describe what I
was trying to test and how it worked out. 

I may not do this for every fort, but I may as well try.
