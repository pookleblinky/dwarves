So the idea is each fortress gets on org file. Not gonna add this to emacs orgs,
just gonna fire up emacs on one directly. May even use vim just for efficiency.

Amostatten is my first doing this. Dunno what level of description I want, so I'm just gonna wing it.

After a few fortresses under my belt I'll have dialed in how to log em.

I have a feeling the postmortems are gonna be interesting.
