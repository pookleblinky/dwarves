I originally thought I'd backup a dwarf, or a fortress. 

After seeing how confusing the save process is, and playing a bit of both, I
decided to switch it up.

---------------

Folders
fortresses.org: Logs of notable fortresses, with various levels of detail
Worlds are named by Name-Mode (advent, fort, legend, general purpose, etc)
regions: world-gen-params for various worlds saves: If I come across a cool
embark location or encounter an interesting problem, I may upload the save.
Depends on whether it's worth uploading.

Files
mods.txt: How I've modded things.
whims.org: Whims, such as going for microforts and fubared embarks or such
world_gen.txt: >>'ing world seeds to a single file as I build em.
