I originally thought I'd backup a dwarf, or a fortress. 

After seeing how confusing the save process is, and playing a bit of both, I
decided to switch it up.

I deleted all the regions and saves, starting from scratch.

Now, I am going to create 2 worlds. One for adventuring, one for fortressing.

autosave/backup: none. I'll have to remember to save periodically. The most that
can happen by fucking up is FUN or having to redo work. Both are preferable to
having a huge clutter of save folders and files in a maze of twisty folders that
all look alike.

So: I probably won't be using this anywhere near as often as I thought I would.

I created a folder called regions. Once a world is built, I'll add it and rename
by Name-Mode. The one being made now is gonna be Somkar-Advent, for instance.

Then, I can just start from almost-scratch, reusing these worlds as
needed/wanted instead of making new worlds. Just rm current regions, plop em
down, and start over.

I'll start files, in org, for each fort, in ./fortresses.
